I am a **Full-stack Engineer** with over 5 years of experience building and maintaining enterprise web applications in the banking industry. 

My work primarily engage on backend and frontend development using **Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and SQL**, along with managing **deployment, performance tuning, and production support** across **Windows and Linux** environments.

I love spending my free time exploring **modern technologies** and working on my hobby side projects. Lately, I’ve also been learning **Japanese**, hoping that one day I can speak at a conversational level and watch anime without subtitles.
