I am a **Full-stack Engineer** with over 5 years of experience building and maintaining enterprise web applications in the banking industry. 

My work primarily engage on backend and frontend development using **Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and SQL**, along with managing **deployment, performance tuning, and production support** across **Windows and Linux** environments.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing a hobby project that help me explore and experiment with **modern technologies**. Lately, I’ve been building with emerging frameworks like **React** and **Next.js**, and experimenting with **Astro** and **Supabase**. I’m also learning Japanese, aiming to reach **JLPT N3** by 2026, because curiosity drives everything I do, in tech and beyond.
